# Template ID Issue Diagnosis

## Problem
- Template ID `e7ba8b894c644999a7b38037ea66f4cc9cc524f5` returns 404 when accessed via `/v2/templates/` endpoint
- Document creation works but results in 0 fields detected
- User has screenshot showing configured fields but system detects none

## SignNow API Response
```
{"404":"Unable to find a route to match the URI: v2\/templates\/e7ba8b894c644999a7b38037ea66f4cc9cc524f5"}
```

## Possible Causes
1. **ID is for a document, not a template** - The ID might be from a document created from a template
2. **Template not published** - Template exists but isn't published/active
3. **Template ID format incorrect** - Wrong format or missing characters
4. **API endpoint mismatch** - Template exists but requires different endpoint

## Next Steps
1. Verify document creation still works with this ID
2. Check if this is actually a document ID that needs to be converted to template
3. User needs to verify the exact template ID from SignNow dashboard
4. May need to create a new template with proper ID format

## Current Status
- Document creation: ✅ Works
- Field detection: ❌ Returns 0 fields
- Template validation: ❌ 404 error
- Field mapping: ✅ Correctly aligned with user's screenshot
