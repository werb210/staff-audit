This is a test document for the enhanced write verification system.
It contains more than 100 bytes to pass the minimum file size requirement.
This document will test the safeWriteFileAndVerify function to ensure it properly:

1. Writes the file to disk
2. Verifies the file size meets minimum requirements (100+ bytes)
3. Confirms the file exists on disk after writing
4. Calculates SHA256 checksum after successful write
5. Triggers proper error handling and cleanup on failures

The enhanced write verification system includes:
- Minimum file size validation (100 bytes)
- Immediate file existence verification
- Size comparison between buffer and disk file
- Automatic cleanup on write failures
- Recovery alert system for critical failures
- SHA256 checksum calculation after successful write verification

This test document should successfully pass all validation checks.
Total character count: over 800 characters to ensure robust testing.
