# Production Deployment Issue Analysis

## Problem Identified ✅

**Issue**: Production environment at https://staff.boreal.financial is missing recent updates that exist in development environment.

## Evidence:

### 1. Missing Frontend Features:
- ❌ "Push to External APIs" button not present in production LenderManagement component
- ✅ "Push to External APIs" button working in development

### 2. Backend API Inconsistencies:
- ❌ `/api/lender-products/sync-external` endpoint missing or non-functional in production
- ✅ Same endpoint working perfectly in development (42 products synced successfully)

### 3. CORS Configuration Issues:
- ❌ Production returning "CSRF protection: missing origin" errors
- ✅ Development environment has proper CORS configuration

## Root Cause:

The production deployment is **NOT synchronized** with the current development codebase. While both show version 1.0.0, the production environment is running an **older build** that doesn't include:

1. Updated LenderManagement.tsx with "Push to External APIs" button
2. Updated lenderProducts.ts with `/sync-external` endpoint
3. Latest CORS configuration for external API calls

## Solution Required:

**Manual Production Deployment** needed to sync production with current development code.

## Impact:

- Production users cannot access External API sync functionality
- Feature parity broken between environments
- Production environment is behind development by multiple commits

## Next Steps:

1. Deploy current development code to production
2. Verify all features work in production
3. Confirm feature parity between environments
