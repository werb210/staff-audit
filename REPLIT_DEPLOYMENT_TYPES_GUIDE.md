# Replit Deployment Types Guide

## How to Choose Different Deployment Types

### Step 1: Access Deployment Interface
1. Click the **"Deploy"** button in your Replit sidebar
2. If you have an existing deployment, click **"Settings"** or **"Delete"** to start fresh
3. Click **"Create new deployment"**

### Step 2: Available Deployment Types

#### Option A: Autoscale Deployment (Recommended)
- **Best for**: Production applications with variable traffic
- **Features**: Automatic scaling, load balancing, better performance
- **Cost**: Pay per usage
- **Configuration**: 
  - Build: `npm run build`
  - Start: `npm start`
  - Environment variables required

#### Option B: Static Deployment
- **Best for**: Simple applications, testing
- **Features**: Fixed resources, predictable costs
- **Cost**: Lower, fixed pricing
- **Configuration**:
  - Build: `npm run build:client:fast`
  - Start: `npm start`
  - Same environment variables

#### Option C: Reserved VM Deployment
- **Best for**: High-performance applications
- **Features**: Dedicated resources, always-on
- **Cost**: Higher, fixed pricing
- **Configuration**: Similar to Autoscale

### Step 3: Select Your Deployment Type
When creating a new deployment, you'll see options:
- **"Autoscale Deployment"** ← Click this for production
- **"Static Deployment"** ← Click this for simpler setup
- **"Reserved VM"** ← Click this for dedicated resources

### Step 4: Configure Based on Type

#### For Autoscale (Recommended for you):
```
Build Command: npm run build
Start Command: npm start
Environment Variables: (copy from workspace secrets)
```

#### For Static (If Autoscale fails):
```
Build Command: npm run build:client:fast
Start Command: npm start
Environment Variables: (same as above)
```

## Your Current Situation

Given your 10+ failed deployments, try this order:

1. **First attempt**: Autoscale Deployment
   - Most suitable for your application
   - Better performance and scaling

2. **If that fails**: Static Deployment
   - Simpler configuration
   - May avoid some deployment issues

3. **If both fail**: Reserved VM
   - Most reliable but more expensive
   - Dedicated resources

## Key Differences for Your App

| Feature | Autoscale | Static | Reserved VM |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Scaling | Automatic | Fixed | Manual |
| Cost | Variable | Low | High |
| Performance | High | Medium | Highest |
| Reliability | High | Medium | Highest |
| Setup Complexity | Medium | Low | High |

## Recommended Approach

1. Delete your current failed deployment
2. Choose **"Autoscale Deployment"**
3. Configure environment variables carefully
4. If it fails, try **"Static Deployment"**
5. Monitor deployment logs for specific errors

The deployment type selection happens at the very beginning of the deployment setup process in Replit's Deploy interface.
