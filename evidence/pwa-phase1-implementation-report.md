- **Notification Channels**: Categorized notifications (calls, applications, system)
- **Enhanced Options**: Rich notifications with actions, icons, and interaction requirements
- **Permission Management**: Streamlined permission request and status tracking
- **Service Worker Integration**: Seamless integration with existing notification system

**Implementation**: `NotificationManager` with channel-based organization

### 5. **Performance Monitoring** ✅
- **Real-time Metrics**: Cache hit rates, sync status, offline readiness
- **Capabilities Assessment**: Comprehensive PWA feature detection and reporting
- **Health Dashboard**: Visual status indicator with detailed performance metrics
- **Performance Tracking**: Metric collection and analysis for optimization

**Implementation**: `PWAPerformanceMonitor` with comprehensive capability reporting

### 6. **User Interface Enhancements** ✅
- **PWA Status Indicator**: Real-time PWA health and capabilities display
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Detailed PWA status with quick actions
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded status indicators and badges
- **Performance Metrics**: Cache hit rates, sync status, and connection monitoring

**Implementation**: `PWAStatusIndicator` component with real-time updates

## 🚀 Advanced PWA Features

### Real-time Connection Management
```typescript
// Automatic offline detection and sync triggering
const offlineManager = OfflineManager.getInstance();
offlineManager.onConnectionChange((isOnline) => {
  if (isOnline) {
    // Automatically trigger background sync
    triggerBackgroundSync();
  }
});
```

### Intelligent Caching
```typescript
// Preload critical resources for instant access
await CacheManager.preloadCriticalResources();
const stats = await CacheManager.getCacheStats();
// Monitor cache performance: hit rate, size, entry count
```

### Enhanced Notifications
```typescript
// Send categorized notifications with actions
await NotificationManager.sendNotification(
  "Incoming Call", 
  {
    category: "calls",
    actions: [{ action: "accept", title: "Accept" }],
    requireInteraction: true
  }
);
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Get comprehensive PWA health report
const capabilities = await PWAPerformanceMonitor.getCapabilities();
const healthReport = await PWAPerformanceMonitor.generateHealthReport();
```
