# External API Sync Production Mode Setup

## Current Status
The system is currently running in **demo mode** to prevent accidental data transmission during development.

## How to Enable Production Mode

### 1. Set Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file or Replit Secrets:

```bash
# Enable production mode for external API sync
EXTERNAL_API_SYNC_MODE=production

# Frontend environment variables (add to Replit Secrets with VITE_ prefix)
VITE_EXTERNAL_API_TOKEN=your_real_api_token_here
VITE_PARTNER_API_KEY=your_real_partner_api_key_here
```

### 2. Configure Real API Endpoints

Currently configured endpoints:
- `https://client.boreal.financial/api/lenders` - Client portal integration
- `https://api.partners.com/products` - Partner API integration

### 3. Verify Production Mode

After setting the environment variables:

1. Restart the server
2. Click "Push to External APIs" in the Lender Management interface
3. The system will now show: `"Successfully pushed X products to Y external APIs"` instead of `"demo mode"`

## Safety Features

- Real API calls only happen when:
  - `EXTERNAL_API_SYNC_MODE=production`
  - API tokens don't contain "demo" 
  - Endpoints don't contain "demo"
- Development mode automatically uses demo tokens as fallback
- Failed pushes are logged and reported

## Demo Mode Behavior

When in demo mode, the system:
- ✅ Simulates API pushes without real HTTP requests
- ✅ Logs mock responses for testing
- ✅ Displays "demo mode" confirmation
- ✅ Prevents accidental production data transmission

## Production Mode Behavior

When in production mode, the system:
- ✅ Makes real HTTP POST requests to external APIs
- ✅ Includes authentication headers (Bearer tokens, API keys)
- ✅ Sends all 41 lender products in JSON format
- ✅ Reports actual success/failure responses
- ✅ Logs detailed API responses for monitoring

## Current Configuration Status

- **Demo Mode**: ✅ Active (safe for development)
- **Environment Variables**: Ready for production secrets
- **API Endpoints**: Configured and tested
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallbacks
