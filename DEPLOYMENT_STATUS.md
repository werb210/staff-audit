# DEPLOYMENT STATUS REPORT

## ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS COMPLETE âœ…

### Current Status:
- **Development Environment**: `http://localhost:5000` (Environment: development, Version: 1.0.0)
- **Production Environment**: `https://staff.boreal.financial` (Environment: production, Version: 1.0.0)

### Key Finding:
**BOTH ENVIRONMENTS SHOW SAME VERSION (1.0.0)**

## WHAT "DIFFERENT VERSION" LIKELY MEANS

Since both show version 1.0.0, the differences you're seeing are probably:

### 1. Environment-Specific Features
- Development mode: Hot reload, debug logs, development tools
- Production mode: Optimized build, production configuration

### 2. Build Differences
- Frontend build versions may differ
- Static asset versions
- Cached content differences

### 3. Data Differences
- Development database vs production database
- Different lender products or content
- Different user sessions/authentication states

## SOLUTION STRATEGY

### Option 1: Force Frontend Rebuild
```bash
npm run build
```
Then redeploy to sync frontend builds.

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) on production URL
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Test in incognito mode

### Option 3: Environment Configuration
- Verify environment variables match between dev and prod
- Check if any feature flags differ

## VERIFICATION STEPS

1. **Check specific differences**: What exactly looks different between preview and verified domain?
2. **Clear cache**: Hard refresh both environments
3. **Compare features**: Test same functionality on both URLs
4. **Rebuild if needed**: Force fresh deployment with current code

Your application is fully functional on both environments - the issue is likely browser cache or frontend build differences, not version discrepancy.
