- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced filtering capabilities
- **Role-Based Access**: Enhanced security beyond V1 spec
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full mobile compatibility
- **V2 Design System**: Professional enterprise styling

### ✅ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

#### Status Tracking
- **✅ Pipeline Position**: Stage determines priority
- **✅ Visual Progress**: Clear stage indicators  
- **✅ SMS Notifications**: Document rejection alerts
- **✅ History Logging**: All stage changes tracked

#### Staff Efficiency
- **✅ Drag-and-Drop**: Quick status updates
- **✅ One-Click Details**: Full application access
- **✅ Color Coding**: Visual scanning support
- **✅ Batch Operations**: Multiple selection capability

### 🔄 AUTOMATIC TRANSITIONS

#### Current Implementation Status
- **✅ New → In Review**: Triggered on "View Details" click
- **⚠️ Document-Based**: Manual review required (matches V1)
- **✅ Validation**: Invalid transitions prevented
- **✅ Business Rules**: All V1 rules implemented

### 📊 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

#### Current Advantages Over V1
1. **Modern Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, TanStack Query
2. **Enterprise Database**: PostgreSQL with proper relationships
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Live data synchronization
4. **Security**: JWT authentication and role-based access
5. **Scalability**: Multi-tenant architecture
6. **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints with validation

## Implementation Gaps Analysis

### 🟡 Minor Cosmetic Updates Needed
1. **Stage Naming**: Consider updating to exact V1 names for consistency
   - "Requires Docs" → "Required Docs"
   - "Off to Lender" → "Lender Review"
   - "Accepted" → "Approved"

2. **Color Scheme**: Implement 10-color rotation system as specified in V1
   - Currently using stage-based colors (works better)
   - V1 spec suggests rotating card colors

### ✅ Areas Where We Exceed V1
1. **Real Database Integration**: V1 was likely using mock data
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Search, industry, amount, date filters
3. **Pipeline Analytics**: Real-time metrics and reporting  
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch-friendly drag and drop
5. **Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication
6. **Scalability**: Multi-tenant, role-based system

## Compliance Summary

| Feature Category | Compliance Rate | Notes |
