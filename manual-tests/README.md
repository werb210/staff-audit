# 🎬 28 Manual Button Proofs - Comprehensive Evidence Framework

## Overview
This framework provides systematic evidence capture for all staff portal functionality through manual testing with screen recordings and network traffic analysis.

## Test Structure

### 📋 Categories
1. **Authentication & Navigation (Proofs 1-6)**
   - Staff login, dashboard, tab navigation, user profile

2. **Application Workflow (Proofs 7-14)**
   - Create, edit, status change, search, export, notes, assignment, archive

3. **Document Management (Proofs 15-21)**
   - Upload, download, preview, bulk operations, categories, approval, security

4. **Communication & Advanced (Proofs 22-28)**
   - Email, SMS, calendar, reports, lenders, marketing, system admin

## Evidence Requirements

### 📹 For Each Proof
- **MP4 Recording**: Screen capture showing complete workflow
- **HAR File**: Network traffic showing API calls and responses
- **Screenshots**: Key states and confirmation screens (optional)

### 📦 Naming Convention
- `proof-{number}-{timestamp}.mp4`
- `proof-{number}-{timestamp}.har`
- Example: `proof-1-2025-08-08T14-30-15.mp4`

## Usage Instructions

1. **Open Framework**: Load `proof-framework.html` in browser
2. **Start Proof**: Click "Start Proof X" button for specific test
3. **Record Evidence**: Framework auto-starts recording and guides through steps
4. **Complete Proof**: Follow test steps, capture evidence, stop recording
5. **Export Evidence**: Download HAR files and evidence package

## Validation Criteria

### ✅ Each Proof Must Include
- Complete workflow demonstration
- All button clicks and interactions
- API calls showing proper authentication
- Success/error states as appropriate
- Network traffic proving security implementation

### 📊 Success Metrics
- All 28 proofs completed: 100%
- Evidence files captured: 56 files minimum (28 MP4 + 28 HAR)
- No security vulnerabilities exposed in recordings
- All workflows functional end-to-end

## Integration Points

### 🔗 Staff Portal URLs
- Main Portal: `/portal`
- Authentication: `/portal/login`
- Applications: `/portal/applications`
- Documents: `/portal/documents`
- Communication: `/portal/communication`

### 🛡️ Security Verification
Each proof validates the production security fixes:
- Protected endpoints return 401 without auth
- JWT tokens properly required and validated
- No sensitive data exposed in network traffic
- Cross-silo access properly restricted

## Automation Support

### 📸 Screen Recording
- Browser-based recording API integration
- Automatic start/stop with proof workflow
- Quality settings: 1080p, 30fps recommended

### 🌐 Network Capture
- HAR export from browser DevTools
- Automatic filtering of relevant API calls
- Privacy filtering of sensitive headers
