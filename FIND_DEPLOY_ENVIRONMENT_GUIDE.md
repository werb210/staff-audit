# FIND YOUR DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT GUIDE

## IMMEDIATE DETECTION STEPS

### Step 1: Check Replit Deploy Tab
1. Click "Deploy" in left sidebar of Replit
2. Look for "Active Deployments" section
3. Note any listed deployment URLs

### Step 2: Check Your Verified Domain
Your verified domain might be one of these:
- `https://staff.boreal.financial`
- `https://staffportal.replit.app`
- Custom domain you configured

### Step 3: Environment Identification
Run this in browser console on each URL:
```javascript
fetch('/api/version')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Environment:', d.environment, 'Version:', d.version))
```

## DEPLOYMENT SYNCHRONIZATION

### If You Find Multiple Active Environments:
1. **Development**: Shows latest code changes
2. **Production**: Shows older deployed version
3. **Solution**: Redeploy production to match development

### If No Production Environment Found:
1. **Create new deployment** in Replit Deploy tab
2. **Use these settings**:
   - Build: `npm run build`
   - Start: `npm start`
   - Environment: All your current secrets

### If Production Environment Exists but Wrong Version:
1. **Delete existing deployment**
2. **Create fresh deployment** with current code
3. **Verify version matches** development environment

## CRITICAL INSIGHT
Your development environment (workspace) will ALWAYS show current code.
Your production environment only updates when you redeploy.

The "different version" issue means you have a production deployment that hasn't been updated with your latest code changes.
