# Deployment Status Explanation

## What You're Seeing vs What's Actually Happening

### WORKSPACE (What you see now)
- **Mode**: Development
- **Command**: `npm run dev`
- **Purpose**: Code development and testing
- **Always runs in development mode**

### DEPLOYMENT (Separate environment)
- **Mode**: Production (if successful)
- **Command**: `npm start`
- **Purpose**: Live production application
- **Runs independently from workspace**

## Why You're Confused

When you click "Deploy" in Replit:
1. **Workspace stays in development** (what you see)
2. **Deployment creates separate production environment**
3. **Two different environments running simultaneously**

## How to Check Your Actual Deployment

### Step 1: Go to Deploy Tab
- Click "Deploy" in Replit sidebar
- Look for "Active Deployments" section

### Step 2: Check Deployment Status
- **If deployment is running**: You'll see deployment URL
- **If deployment failed**: You'll see error logs
- **If no deployment**: Nothing in Active Deployments

### Step 3: Access Production App
- **Successful deployment**: Click deployment URL
- **Production mode**: Will show different environment
- **Your actual users**: Access this URL, not workspace

## The Answer to Your Question

**Your WORKSPACE is in development mode** (this will never change)

**Your DEPLOYMENT mode depends on**:
- Whether deployment succeeded
- Whether you can access deployment URL
- Whether environment variables transferred correctly

## To Definitively Answer

1. **Check Replit Deploy tab** for active deployments
2. **If deployment exists**: Production mode
3. **If no deployment**: No production environment yet

Your workspace will always show development - the production version is a separate environment accessible via deployment URL.
