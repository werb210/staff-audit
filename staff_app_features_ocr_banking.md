  6. Transaction patterns (large deposits, recurring payments, unusual activity)
  7. Business vs personal indicators (business deposits, personal withdrawals, operating expenses)
  8. Risk factors with severity levels (Low/Medium/High)
  9. Financial health score (0-100 scale)
  10. Actionable recommendations for loan underwriting
