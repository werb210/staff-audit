## 🔁 RESTORATION INSTRUCTIONS

### 🔹 Scenario 1: **Document Record Exists in DB but File is Missing**

This is the most common scenario after the incident. To **restore the file**:

#### ✅ Re-upload Using the Built-In "Re-upload" Button

1. **Open the Sales Pipeline**
2. Click the application card with the red ⚠️ missing document icon
3. Go to the **Documents** tab
4. Locate the document with red warning: *"File missing"*
5. Click the yellow **"Re-upload"** button beside it
6. Upload the correct file for that document
7. System will:
   - Attach the file to the **existing document ID**
   - Maintain all metadata
   - Update the preview/download buttons automatically

> ✅ No database records are deleted — only the file is replaced.

### 🔹 Scenario 2: **File Exists on Disk but DB Record is Missing**

This is less common. To restore the **document record**:

#### 🛠 Manual Recovery Steps (Replit Staff Only):

1. Locate the orphaned file in `uploads/documents/`
   ```bash
   ls uploads/documents/*.pdf
   ```

2. Note the filename (should be the UUID).
   Example: `a1234bcd-5678-90ef-gh12-ijkl345678mn.pdf`

3. Run SQL to re-create the DB record:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO documents (id, application_id, file_name, document_type, file_path, file_size, created_at)
   VALUES (
     'a1234bcd-5678-90ef-gh12-ijkl345678mn',         -- document ID from filename
     'APPLICATION_ID_HERE',                          -- must match application
     'March 2025.pdf',                               -- original file name
     'bank_statements',                              -- enum category
     'uploads/documents/a1234bcd-5678-90ef-gh12-ijkl345678mn.pdf',
     204800,                                         -- file size in bytes
     NOW()
   );
   ```

4. Refresh the frontend UI — the document will now appear and be viewable/downloadable.
