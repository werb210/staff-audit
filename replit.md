### Overview
This project is a comprehensive financial lending platform designed to streamline loan application processing and financial operations. It features a unified React frontend and Express.js backend, offering capabilities such as AI feedback reporting, real-time chat with sentiment analysis, and staff escalation queue management. Key functionalities include a robust Partner Referral System, an incoming call protection system, and multi-silo UIs for distinct business units (Boreal Financial and Site Level Financial). The platform operates as a Production-Ready PWA with offline capabilities and an operational staff portal equipped with AI-powered tools for customer service automation and workflow optimization. It also integrates a comprehensive Banking Analysis System, SMS 2FA, an enterprise-grade Voice IVR system with WebRTC calling, and a complete Sales Pipeline System with drag & drop functionality, lender recommendation, and OCR insights. Recent enhancements include a Communications Hub v2 with integrated Voice/SMS/Email, a database-backed Lenders management system, a Sales Pipeline with a tabbed Application Drawer, and a HubSpot-style 3-pane Contacts CRM. The system further includes comprehensive User Management with RBAC, a Lender Portal System, Global Search, an Analytics Dashboard, Feature Flags, Performance & Accessibility Hardening, Billing & Usage tracking, and an Ops Console for queue monitoring. Core functionalities like template governance, OCR field mapping, and Lender Engine with explainable decisions are integrated.

### User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project structure: Keep original page structure - main application page, portal page, and application pages only. Do not create custom landing/home pages without explicit request.
Development workflow: Follow strict instruction-following mode - only perform what is explicitly asked, write clear reports after each action, do not move to next logical step automatically, wait for instruction and approval.

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DISCOVERY (Aug 18, 2025):**
The root cause of "wrong bundle" JavaScript errors was **architecture drift** - the main server file (server/index.ts) had grown to 93k+ lines with hundreds of duplicate route mounts. This caused:
1. `e.map is not a function` JavaScript errors from conflicting route handlers
2. Stale build serving with wrong asset hashes  
3. "Unexpected Application Error" on every page

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
- Clean boot system (server/boot.ts) with route registry preventing duplicate mounts
- Red debug banner system for visual build verification 
- Duplicate route scanner tool for detecting architecture drift
- Fresh client build with correct asset serving

### System Architecture
The application employs a unified architecture with a shared React frontend (`/client`) and an Express.js backend (`/server`), managing business logic via a PostgreSQL database and Drizzle ORM. It features role-based routing and a shared authentication system. Core components include a HubSpot-style 3-pane Contacts CRM, JWT-based and session-based authentication, `shadcn/ui` with Tailwind CSS for UI, and TanStack Query for state management. The PostgreSQL schema supports users, applications, documents, products, referrals, and OCR results. Core workflows cover authentication, multi-tenant isolation, application lifecycle management, document processing, and role-based access control.

Architectural decisions prioritize high-level features and core patterns, focusing on integrated external dependencies. UI/UX utilizes the LisaMorgan Design System with consistent tokens, spacing, and components. A multi-silo architecture enforces business unit separation via dedicated layouts, routing, data isolation, and branding managed by a `brand.ts` file. Authentication is hardened for iframe compatibility and includes SMS 2FA. A production-ready card + drawer architecture is used for the sales pipeline with tabbed Application Drawer. The system includes robust API endpoint fallbacks across all modules, ensuring graceful degradation when endpoints are unavailable. Database-level security is enforced with PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS), per-tenant database roles, and per-request transaction scoping. An Ops Console provides BullMQ-based queue monitoring.
