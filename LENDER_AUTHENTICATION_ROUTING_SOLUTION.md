# Lender Authentication & Routing Solution

## Current Issue
When lenders log in with credentials you provide them, they currently see the **general staff dashboard** instead of their dedicated lender portal.

## What Lenders Currently See (Problem)
**URL:** `http://localhost:5000/` or `/dashboard`
**Content:** General staff dashboard with:
- Total Applications across all lenders
- Total Pipeline Value (all applications) 
- Approval Rate statistics
- Pending Review count
- Recent Applications from all lenders
- Quick Actions (New Application, Manage Contacts, View Reports, Review Queue)

**Security Risk:** Lenders can see data from all other lenders and staff operations.

## What Lenders Should See (Solution)
**URL:** `/apps/lender-portal/`
**Content:** Dedicated Lender Portal with:

### 1. Lender Dashboard
- Statistics specific to their products only
- Applications submitted for their products
- Their approval rates and performance metrics
- Revenue and pipeline specific to their lending products

### 2. My Products Page
- Manage only their own lending products
- Add/edit/disable their products
- Set interest rates, terms, and requirements
- Cannot see other lenders' products

### 3. Applications Page
- View applications submitted specifically for their products
- Review and approve/reject applications for their products
- Cannot see applications for other lenders

### 4. Role-Based Security
- JWT token with "lender" role restriction
- Database queries filtered by their lender_id
- Cannot access staff or admin functions

## Implementation Solution

### Step 1: Update Authentication Response
```typescript
// server/routes/lenderAuth.ts - Already implemented
res.json({
  success: true,
  user: { ... },
  token,
  redirectUrl: '/apps/lender-portal' // Direct lenders to their portal
});
```

### Step 2: Create Lender Portal Route Handler
The dedicated lender portal exists at `/apps/lender-portal/` with:
- Separate React application
- Independent authentication system
- Lender-specific API endpoints
- Role-based data filtering

### Step 3: Configure Proper Routing
Lenders should access: `https://your-domain.com/apps/lender-portal/`

## Test Lender Account
**Email:** lender@boreal.com
**Password:** testpass123
**Lender Company:** Boreal Financial Partners
**Products:** 12 assigned lending products

## Production URLs
- **Staff Portal:** `https://staff.boreal.financial/`
- **Lender Portal:** `https://staff.boreal.financial/apps/lender-portal/`
- **Client Portal:** `https://clientportal.boreal.financial/`

## Security Verification
- Lenders cannot access `/dashboard`, `/applications`, `/contacts`, etc.
- Lenders can only access `/apps/lender-portal/*` routes
- API endpoints filter data by lender_id
- JWT tokens include lender role verification

## Next Steps
1. Provide lenders with credentials you create through the lender management system
2. Direct them to: `/apps/lender-portal/`
3. They will see only their products and applications
4. Staff portal remains separate for internal use

This ensures proper separation between staff operations and lender access.
